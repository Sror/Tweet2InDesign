Tweet2InDesign
==============

Pull Tweets form the Twitter API into an InDesign File

The main point is to provide very rough, basic example of using Extendables' UI and HTTP libraries, and parsing a JSON response. If you've never used Javascript in Adobe applications, you can also pick up a bit about their DOM manipulation abilities by looking at the script example.

Tested in CS6, not tested in anything lower yet. Feel free to submit bugs for them though.

To install:
* Install the Extendables framework: http://github.com/stdbrouw/extendables (put it in Applications > InDesign > Scripts)
* Install Tweet2InDesign.jsx in Applications > InDesign > Scripts > Scripts Panel
* Open Scripts Panel in Indesign from Window > Utilities > Script Panel and then double click Tweet2InDesign.jsx
