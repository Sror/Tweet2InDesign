Tweet2InDesign
==============

Pull Tweets form the Twitter API into an InDesign File

The main point is to provide very rough, basic example of using Extendables' UI and HTTP libraries, and parsing a JSON response. If you've never used Javascript in Adobe applications, you can also pick up a bit about their DOM manipulation abilities by looking at the script example.

Tested in CS6, not tested in anything lower yet.

To install:
1. Install the Extendables framework: http://github.com/stdbrouw/extendables (put it in Applications > InDesign > Scripts)
2. Install Tweet2InDesign.jsx in Applications > InDesign > Scripts > Scripts Panel
3. Open Scripts Panel in Indesign from Window > Utilities > Script Panel and then double click Tweet2InDesign.jsx
